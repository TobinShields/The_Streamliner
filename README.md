|===========================================================================|
"The Streamliner" is a simple Python utility that allows users to target a particular webpage or text file and filter all of the email addresses that contained within it. Written using Python 3, this tool is especially useful when distilling large web directories, cluttered or poorly formatted email lists, or web pages with mailto: links into a txt or csv file

## Disclamer
While “The Streamliner” is a fairly innocuous tool, it was built to help aid penetration testers during the information gathering phase of a project. While OSINT is not illegal, as always, be sure that you have the permission of whoever you are collecting information on. This should not be a very noisy program, but it will show that you requested a given page.

## Suport this project!
I am fairly new to Python. If you see a better way of doing something, then feel free to contribute and make this better! Also, if you want to add a feature or expand the functionality of this program then I would gladly welcome the additions. See the changelog for information of version differences.
